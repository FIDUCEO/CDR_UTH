All scripts that are needed to process the l3 UTH CDR are located in the folder FIDUCEO/CDR_UTH/processing. 

Important: The python package "Typhon" is needed for the processing. It is a collection of tools for atmospheric research for Python 3. 
It is available under: http://radiativetransfer.org/tools/  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overview of code:

The following Python scripts are needed for the CDR processing:

processing/run_batch_missions.py
processing/sbatch_simple
processing/create_CDR_year.py
processing/processing/FCDRs.py
processing/processing/CDRs.py
processing/processing/utils.py
processing/processing/__init__.py

Additional scripts can be used for plotting, but are not needed for the processing itself.

The core processing script is create_CDR_year.py. It creates monthly CDR files from one year of FCDR files for a specified instrument
and satellite. When called via run_batch_missions.py, several years of data can be processed in parallel. 
create_CDR_year.py uses FCDRs.py to read in the FCDR data, filter clouds, apply quality masks and scale brightness temperature to UTH.
CDRs.py is used to aggregate pixels on a lat/lon grid, perform monthly averaging and write the data to NetCDF files.

Procedure: Run CDR production

To run the CDR processing without any changes to version 1.2., proceed with section B. If you want to make changes to some CDR parameters, start with section A:

Section A:

1. Open the script create_CDR_year.py and move to the section 'CDR CHARACTERISTICS TO SPECIFY'.
2. To change the number of pixels around nadir in the satellite swath that are used for the CDR processing, edit the variable pixels_around_nadir.
3. To change the regression coefficients used to scale brightness temperature to UTH, edit the variables regression_params_path and regression_params_file.
4. To change the boundaries and resolution of the lat/lon grid, edit the variables lat_boundaries, lon_boundaries and resolution.


Section B:

1. Open the script run_batch_missions.py
2. Specify the following parameters:
	version (string): CDR version (will be integrated in the filename and the global attributes in the CDR files)
	version_comment (string): Comment on this CDR version
	fcdr_path (string): Path to the FCDR files. Note that the subfolders are expected to have the following format: /SATELLITE/YEAR/MONTH/DAY
	cdr_path (string): Path to store the CDR files.
	overwrite (boolean): When set to "True", existing CDR files are overwritten
	instruments (list of strings): List of instruments for which CDR is processed
	satellites (dictionary): Satellites to be processed for each instrument
	start_year (dictionary): First year to be processed for each instrument and satellite
	end_year (dictionary): Last year to be processed for each instrument and satellite
3. Run run_batch_missions.py and thereby send jobs to the queue. The script create_CDR_year.py is called separately for each instrument, satellite and year.
