# CDR_UTH

Development code for UTH CDR

The folder processing contains the Python code to process the 1c FIDUCEO Microwave FCDR to the l3 UTH CDR.

Note that you will need additional code to execute the processing: The CDR-generator code makes use of the open source code "typhon", available through http://www.radiativetransfer.org/tools/

An overview of the code and its usage is provided in overview_CDR_processing.txt in processing.

A description of the CDR processing chain can be found in the UTH CDR Product User Guide V1.0.
